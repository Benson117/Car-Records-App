# Car-Records-App
A secondhand motor dealership, SACD Preowned, offers high-end used vehicles.  Compared to other dealers, this is the only company that has long-term business  experience operating in the used motor industry for 20 years. As a flagship dealership of SACD Preowned, the dealership provides high-quality customer service and inspects the 
vehicle personally for even the slightest flaw before selling it to its valued customers. It  was requested that you create an App for the owner so they can enter car records into their database and view the currently available and for sale cars.

Create a class called HotelRoom that contains an integer field for the room number and a double 
field for the nightly rental rate. Provide get methods for these fields as well as a constructor that 
takes an integer argument representing the room number. Rates are set by the constructor based 
on the room number. Rooms numbered 299 and below are R1116.83 per night, and other rooms 
are R1436.14 per night. Build an extended class named Suite whose constructor requires the hotel 
room number and adds a surcharge (tax) of R 638 to the regular rate, based again on the room 
number

Create an application named UseHotelRoom that creates an object of each class and 
demonstrates that it works correctly. The files should be saved as “HotelRoom.java”, “Suite.java”, 
and “UseHotelRoom.java”.
Provide screen captures of your working classes "HotelRoom", "Suite", and "UseHotelRoom" as 
your answers once you have completed all programs without errors.
